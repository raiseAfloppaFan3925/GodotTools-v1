# GodotTools-v1
An addon for Godot that adds some utilities like screenshotting.

_Note: GodotTools only supports Godot 4.2 and not previous versions like 4.1.x and 3.x._

## Additions
  GodotTools adds some utilities to Godot, both in the editor and GDScript.

### ScreenshotTool
  GodotTools provides a tool called ScreenshotTool that you can use in your code to screenshot the 2D and 3D views. You can even screenshot in the editor from a dock. This is the main feature of GodotTools, but it kind of sucks because the 2D and 3D screenshots only work in the editor, as screenshotting during a game will screenshot both 2D and 3D.
